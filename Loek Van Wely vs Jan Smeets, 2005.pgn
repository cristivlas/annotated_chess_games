1. d4 {Here's a very modern game (NED championship 2005).  This is a completely
wild line, and Van Wely made a nice find in it, though it's quite a subtle
move.} d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 e6 5. Bg5
{White has a very powerful pin on the f6 knight.} dxc4
6. e4 {Black grabs a pawn and white grabs the
lion's share of the center as well as preparing to add pressure to f6 with
a later e5.} b5 {Black holds his pawn.} 7. e5 {White adds pressure, this
is the natural move to make, but 7.a4 also deserves attention.} h6 {This is the best
move to save the double attacked knight on f6.  7... b4 is easily met by
8.Ne4 adding even more pressure to the pinned knight on f6.} 8. Bh4 {White's
key point is his pressure on f6, this move retains that.} g5 {Black must
shut down the pressure on f6.} 9. Nxg5 {White is willing to give up a piece
to keep the pressure on f6.  While he will lose his f3 knight, his pin
will win the knight on f6.} hxg5 10. Bxg5 Nbd7 {This move
stops 11.Bxf6 which would give white a superpowerful bishop on f6.  White
won't play Bxf6 because the g5 bishop is more important than either of
the knights, black is covered with dark squared holes (notice how all his
pawns but one are on light squares).  White should keep his dark squared
bishop to attack the undefended dark squares, thus he can't exchange it
for a white if he wants an advantage.  Black can also play 10... Be7 to
cover f6, but 10... Nbd7 beginning black's queenside development is more
popular.} 11. exf6 {While this move looks the obvious way to regain material
(and even be a pawn up) there is an alternative in 11.g3- the knight is
pinned and white doesn't have to take immediately.  Both moves have merits,
and they can easily transpose.} Bb7 {Taking back on f6 with the d7 knight
giving white another nasty pin on f6.  Black would equalize material, but
he can do that almost anytime, and there's no need to give white a pin.
 Also for the moment the pawn on f6 gets in the way of white's bishop and
black should be in no hurry to take such a helpful pawn.} 12. g3 {e2 is
an inactive square for the bishop, g2 actively targets black's weak queenside.
 This move prepares to put the bishop on it's ideal square.} c5 {But it
also opens up black's diagonal, he now threatens Bxh1.} 13. d5 {White blocks
the diagonal, and he attempts to blast open the position.  Notice that
black can't take on d5 for example: 13... exd5 14.Qe2  Be7 15.fxe7.  Note
that if black allows the position to open, the pawn on f6 suddenly becomes
a huge help for white.} Qb6 {Black has to cover e6 as after an eventual
dxe6 fxe6 white's pawn on f6 becomes a monster of a protected, passed pawn.
 It can get in white's way but black has to be INCREDIBLY careful about
it.  There are two alternatives to 13... Qb6 though neither are are common.
 13... Bh6 trades off white's valuable dark squared bishop.  The second
alternative, 13... Qc7 threatens the dangerous 14... Qe5 .} 14. Bg2 {White
finishes his pieces development and covers d5.} O-O-O 15. O-O {Opposite
side castling frequently leads to EXPLOSIVE attacks.  Black has open files
to work with against white's king, and white tries to exploit the overly
advanced queenside pawns for black.} b4 {This is the generally recognized
way for black to play, he tries for activity on BOTH sides.  While white
tends to be the attacker, black can strike on both sides.} 16. Rb1 {This
is the modern response to 15... b4 but 16.Na4 is also a strong move for
white to play.  White tries to attack on the queenside.  This move is willing
to give up the c3 knight for the open b file.} Qa6 {Black gets his queen
out of the line of fire.} 17. dxe6 {White continues to go for the attack,
and in order to do this he opens up the game.  The pawns on e6 and f6 are
marching forwards and the bishop on b7 is attacked, which is a key piece
to defend black's kingside.} Bxg2 {Black trades, because if white was allowed
to take on b7, either black's king or queen would end up on the dangerous
b file, where white's rook is.} 18. e7 {If white took back on g2 black
would be allowed to play 18...Qxe6 where white's pawns are no longer rolling,
his attacking (and defensive) bishop on g2 has been traded and finally
white's knight on c3 would be attacked.  With this move white forces his
pawns through the defensive lines.} Bxf1 {Black sees material and he grabs
material.  If black can still defend this is a good choice, if not it's
a very dangerous one to go for material.  However, what choice does he
have?  After 18... bxc3 19.exd8=Q  followed by Kxg2 gives white a nice
material edge.} 19. Qd5 {19.Qd5!! is a very powerful move that prepares
20.Bf4 (cutting off the square the black king can move to) followed by
the winning move Qa8 .} Bh6 {Black tries to get rid of white's powerful
bishop.  19... Bxe7 is also possible, it was played in the spectacular
game at Dortmund 1996 Topalov-Kramnik.  Anyone who finds the opening at
all exciting should definitely check out that game (maybe I'll annotate
it later).  19... Bd3 (getting the bishop out of the way) loses here after
20.Bf4! (threatening 21.Qa8  Nb8 22.Qxb8  Kc7 23.exd8=Q  with a very simple
win for white.  In fact the main point of 19... Bh6 is not to get the dark
squared bishop, it's to connect rooks so that when d8 falls it will be
adequately defended.} 20. Bxh6 {If white tries to avoid the trade with
20.Bh4 his bishop will be completely out of the game (where's it gonna
go from h4, except maybe back to g5?)} Bd3 {Black can't take back as 20...Rxh6
leaves blacks king in the danger zone (the rooks aren't connected any longer)
and white must has a crazy attack coming one, 21.Qa8  Nb8 22.Qxb8 ! Kxb8
23.exd8=Q  Qc8 (23... Kb7 24.Re1!! where the following Re7  will easily
win for white) 24.Qd6 Qc7 (24... Kb7 25.Re1! wins with the following Re7
) 25.Qf8  where after the tactics, white is up a piece.} 21. Qa8+ {The
obvious, and probably correct way to continue the attack.  21.Ne4 is an
interesting alternative tried by Shirov, he gets his knight out of the
way, and prepares to use it in the attack.} Nb8 {The only move, as 21...
Kc7 provokes 22.Bf4  1-0.} 22. exd8=Q+ Rxd8 23. Re1 {White must move his
rook out of the danger, and he has threats of the powerful Re7.} bxc3 24.
Bf4 {White doesn't need to retake, and he continues his scary attack.}
Qb6 {The other logical move, 24... Qb7 (both moves defend b8, this one
tries to trade queens) loses to the pretty 25.Re7!! Qxa8 26.Rc7#.} 25.
bxc3 {Now white retakes as there is no immediate threat.} Bf5 {This is
a move first played to my knowledge by Shirov (a major proponent of this
opening for both colors).  Black brings the bishop back to where it can
enter the defense.} 26. f3 {26.f3!! white cannot advance his attack on
the queenside (26.Re7?? loses to 26...Qb1! where black gets the attack)
so he mobilizes his kingside pawn majority.  To prepare the advance of
his kingside Van Wely first grabs control of the light squares, he prepares
to play g4 to support his h pawns advance.  This is Van Wely's novelty.
 Until this game this position was considered a draw, though black's defense
had to be ingenious.  Check out Azmaiparashvili-Shirov to see an amazing
save.} Be6 {Black gets ready to play 27... Bd5 forcing the queens off the
board, the position is still very dangerous.  Another way is 27... Qb7
but it's bad, as shown by 28.Qxb7  Kxb7 29.Re7  Rd7 30.Bb8 Kb8 31.g4 (starting
kingside expansion) 31... Be6 32.Rxe6! fxe6 33.g5 and the pawns are better
than the rook, analysis in this position by Geert van der Stricht in New
In Chess #77.} 27. g4 {White expands, following his plan.} Bd5 {Black forces
queens off with an extra piece, but the pawns will be too strong.} 28.
Qxb8+ Qxb8 29. Bxb8 Kxb8 30. Kf2 {White defends his f3 pawn before beginning
to march (and activate his rook).} Kc7 31. h4 {The kingside continues to
push forward.} Rd6 32. Re7+ Rd7 33. h5 {And the pawns give white an easy
win, notice how 26.f3!! stopped the bishop from coming to e4 and being
able to stop the h pawn.}  1-0
