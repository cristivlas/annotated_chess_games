1.c4 g6 2.g3 c5 3.Bg2 Bg7 4.Nc3 Nc6 5.Nf3 Nh6 
{A rather artificial formation.} 
6.h4 d6 7.d3 Rb8 8.h5 Bd7 9.Bxh6 Bxh6 10.hxg6 hxg6 
{White's tactical operations on the kingside have resulted in an open h- file and a pin on the bishop at h6.} 
11.Qc1 
{This forces Black's reply, since the queen cannot be captured because of mate at h8.} 
Bg7 12.Rxh8+ Bxh8 13.Qh6 
{White is attacking effectively with the queen, to be supported by a knight.} 
Bxc3+ 14.bxc3 
{Now the Black king has no defense. We soon have an example of a king hunt, where the enemy monarch will be chased all over the board and finally snared far from home.} 
e6 15.Ng5 Ke7 16.Kd2 
{The White king will be safe here and now the rook can transfer to the h-file.} 
Be8 17.Qg7 Kd7 18.f4 
{18.Nxf7 Qe7} 
Qe7 19.Rh1 Nd8 20.Ne4 Kc7 21.Rh8 Bc6 22.Nf6 
{What happens if Black captures the bishop at g2?} 
Kb6 
{22...Bxg2 23.Re8} 
23.Bxc6 Nxc6 24.Rh7 Nd8 
{Now White exploits the pin on the seventh rank.} 
25.Qxg6 Ka6 
{Black appreciates the danger. Once White captures at f7 there will be a fork available at d7.} 
26.a4 
{Keeping the Black king hemmed in. Otherwise b7-b5 would be possible.} 
Ka5 27.Qg5 Kxa4 28.Rh1 
{The threat is Kc2, depriving the enemy king of another flight square.} 
Kb3 29.Qh4 Kb2 30.g4 
{This is the simple way, but Botvinnik could have finished more elegantly. 30.Rb1+ Kxb1 31.Qh1+ Kb2 32.Qc1+ Kb3 33.Qb1+ Ka3 34. Kc2 and mate next move.} 
1-0
