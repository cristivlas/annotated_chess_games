1. e4 {Quite frankly this is one of the best games ever played, Kasparov once
again plays a daring gambit in full knowledge that Karpov and his seconds have
had over a week to prepare for it. Kasparov's idea is so deep that even Karpov
underestimated the strength of it and is dragged into a position where
his pieces are helpless due to a dominating knight on d3. Karpov refuses
to return the pawn which allows Kasparov to dominate the game, in the end
Karpov is bound hand and foot and all he can do is sit and await his execution}
 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nb5 d6 6. c4 Nf6
7. N1c3 a6 8. Na3 d5 {?! this is the gambit, aptly named the Kasparov gambit}
9. cxd5 exd5 10. exd5 Nb4 11. Be2 {! This was Karpovs improvement over
the 12th game of the match when, after 11.Bc4 Bg4! Kasparov equalised without
trouble and the game ended in a quick draw} Bc5 {?! there is a great idea
behind this move but there is a slight tactical flaw. this in no way takes
anything away from the genious of Kasparovs idea.} 12. O-O {?! 12.Be3!
Bxe3 13.Qa4 essentially refutes the idea and is what Karpov played a few
weeks later against Van der Wiel} O-O 13. Bf3 {After 13.Bg5 Nbxd5 14.Nxd5
Qxd5 15.Bxf6 Qxd1 16.Rxd1 gxf6 Black should draw without any particular
difficulty - Kasparov} Bf5 {! Preventing the white knight getting into
play via c2 and grabs the d3 square for the knight} 14. Bg5 Re8 {! Kasparov
makes it look easy but it was essential for him to control the e4 square
as white was threatening Be4 when black is robbed of all his compensation}
15. Qd2 {here white should be looking to return the extra pawn, 15.Nc4
is Kasparovs suggestion and he gives the line 15...Bd3 16.a3 Bxc4 (not
16...Bxf1? 17.axb4 Bxc4 18.bxc5 when white has an advantage due to his
connected passed pawns) 17.axb4 Bxb4 18.Re1 Rxe1  19.Qxe1 with a 'complicated
position with chances for both sides'} b5 {! denying the c4 square to the
white knight} 16. Rad1 Nd3 {! Kasparov establishes a monster knight on
d3 that white will struggle to remove.} 17. Nab1 {? Karpov is drifting
now 17.d6 was required here when Kasparov gave the exchange sacrifice 17...Qxd6!
18.Bxa8 Rxa8 as good for black} h6 {! its a good time to kick the bishop
as it cannot go to e3 for tactical reasons} 18. Bh4 {18.Be3?! gives black
the pleasent choice of 18...Rxe3 19.fxe3 Qb6 and 18...Bxe3 19.fxe3 Qb6
20.Be2 Rxe3 21.Kh1 Bg6} b4 {! as black has played ...h6 this exiles the
knight to a4.} 19. Na4 {19.Ne2 is met with g5! with g4 to follow trapping
the light square bishop, and is the reason 17...h6 made 18...b4 even stronger.}
Bd6 {Kasparov wrote that he had reached this position in his preparation
which is amazing considering whites 11th move had never been played before
and whites moves haven't been at all forced. it just shows how much preparation
top players do.} 20. Bg3 Rc8 {! further resticting the white pieces} 21.
b3 {threatening Nb2 forcing the d3 knight away when white would unravel
his pieces. how does black prevent this?} g5 {!! a very good move, not
only does it prevent Nb2 with some simple tactics but there is a much deeper
tactical idea behind it which we will soon see. lets take a quick look
at the white pieces, niether knight can move at all. The queen and rooks
also have no squares. the dark square bishop has no squares and can only
be exchanged for his black counter part. the light square bishop cannot
come to e2 as 22...Ne4 23.Qxd3 Nxg3 wins a piece. so white is pretty much
forced to play} 22. Bxd6 {not 22.Nb2 as 22...Nxb2 23.Qxb2 g4 24.Be2 Rc2
wins a piece. h4 is the only altenative here when 22...Ne4! is winning
but i don't want to bore you with the huge amount of variations here.}
Qxd6 23. g3 {white gives his bishop a retreat square so black is once again
faced with the problem of preventing Nb2. Kasparov would have had to have
seen this at least as early as move 21 else 21...g5 would not have made
much sense.} Nd7 {!! genius, 24.Nb2 Qf6!! 25.Nxd3 Bxd3 26.Bg4 (26.Qxd3??
Ne5! is the sensational point) 26...Ne5! and black is winning} 24. Bg2
{another try is 24.Nc4 which is well met with 24...N7e5 but the variations
that arise after this are too long to go into here.} Qf6 {! Blacks master
piece is complete, the white forces are helpless they must merely wait
for whatever fate has in store} 25. a3 a5 26. axb4 axb4 27. Qa2 {pitiful,
white is reduced to bringing the queen to a2 where she achieves nothing
to threaten to bring a knight to d2, a threat that is easily parryed by
black} Bg6 {opening the queens line to f2, preparing to refute whites only
'active' idea} 28. d6 {white needs to try something else black will have
no problems, building his attack at his lesure. 28.Nd2 fails to 28...Re2
when black crashes through on f2} g4 {black is not interested in the measly
d pawn 28...Qxd6 allows black to start freeing himself with 29.Nd2. } 29.
Qd2 {the queen returns having achieved absolutely nothing} Kg7 {black calmly
defends the h pawn, there is no rush} 30. f3 {white trys to break free
at his kings expence. 30.f4 is met with 30...Bf5 calmly stopping the pawn
before taking advantage of the newly weakened king} Qxd6 {black can now
capture the pawn as the kings position has been sufficiently weakened.}
31. fxg4 Qd4+ 32. Kh1 Nf6 {! threatening Nxg4 and Ne4} 33. Rf4 {33.h3 loses
to 33...Re3 when white can no longer defend} Ne4 34. Qxd3 {the knight was
a key piece in the downfall of the white position and survived on d3 for
no less than 18 moves.} Nf2+ 35. Rxf2 {forced as 35.Kg1 loses to 35...Nh3
  36.Kh1 Qxd3 37.Rxd3 Re1  38.Bf1 (38.Rf1 leads to mate) 38...Nxf4} Bxd3
{now there is an explosion of one sided tactics as Kasparov rounds of this
perfect game} 36. Rfd2 Qe3 {!} 37. Rxd3 Rc1 {!} 38. Nb2 {? this allows
black to force mate but black is won anyway eg. 38.Rxe3 Rxd1  39.Bf1 Rxe3
40.Kg2 Rxb1} Qf2 {! the only way to force mate} 39. Nd2 Rxd1+ {39...Re2!
mates next move} 40. Nxd1 Re1+ {and Karpov resigns.       Kasparov wrote
about this game 'Such games are remembered for a long time, and in particular
by the winner himself, after literally putting part of his soul into the
sustained realization of his plan. ... none of my earlier creations can
compare with this 16th game as regards the grandiosity of the overall plan'
    'What is noteworthy is the fact that this victory was achieved over
such a super class player as Karpov'}  *
