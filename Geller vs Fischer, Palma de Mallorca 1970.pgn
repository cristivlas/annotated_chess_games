15.c4 Bxd4 16.Bxd4 Qxd4 17.e3 Qe5 18.cxd5 cxd5 19.Rfd1 e6 20.Qxa7 Ra8 21.Qd4 
Qxd4 22.Rxd4 Rxa2 23.e4 dxe4 24.Bxe4 Bxe4 25.Rxe4 
{We have reached a double-rook endgame. Black has an extra pawn and control of the seventh rank, but the large number of open files gives White plenty of room to maneuver and, with no pawn weaknesses, White should survive.} 
Rb8 26.Re3 g5 27.h3 Kg7 28.Rc7 
{White takes the seventh rank and threatens to play Rf3, tying down Black's forces.} 
Kg6 29.Rf3 f6 30.Re7 Re2 31.g4 
{White has  a good defensive formation and it is hard to see how Black can make progress. But Fischer is famous for his refusal to agree to draws while there is still play in the position.} 
Rb1+ 32.Kg2 R2e1 33.Ra3 
{This creates an escape path for the king.} 
h5 34.R3a7 Rg1+ 35.Kf3 hxg4+ 36.hxg4 Rb3+ 37.Ke2 Rxg4 38.Rxe6 
{The picture has clarified a bit. But White still has no reason to worry.} 
Rb1 39.R7a6 Rf4 40.Ra2 Rh1 41.Rea6 Rb4 42.R6a4 
{If a pair of rooks are exchanged now, the draw would be fairly simple for White.} 
R4b1 43.Ra8 Rhg1 44.Kf3 Rb5 45.R8a5 Rb3+ 46.Ke2 R3b1 47.Ra8 Kf5 48.R2a5+ 
Kg4 49.Ra4+ Kh5 50.Rh8+ 
{We enter an arid period of maneuvering without much purpose.} 
Kg6 51.Rg8+ Kf7 52.Rd8 Rbe1+ 53.Kf3 Re5 54.Rd2 Rf5+ 55.Ke2 Re5+ 56.Kf3 
Kg6 57.Re4 Rf5+ 58.Ke2 Ra5 59.Re3 Kh5 60.Red3 R5a1 61.Rd8 f5 62.Kf3 Ra3+ 
63.R2d3 g4+ 64.Kf4 
{Now Fischer finally decides to try his hand at the single-rook endgame.} 
Rxd3 65.Rxd3 Rf1 66.Rd2 Kh4 
{66...Kg6 67.Ra2 Black could never make any progress here.} 
67.Kxf5 g3 
{Black uses the pin to advance the pawn. After the game, Geller said he was confused, and thought that he could capture the pawn with check here.} 
68.f4 Kh3 69.Rd3 
{White is prepared to sacrifice the rook for the pawn at the appropriate time, when the Black king is further down the board. The idea is that king and pawn against rook is drawn provided that the pawn is far enough advanced.} 
Kh4 70.Rd2 
{A big mistake. White needs a certain amount of distance between his rook and the enemy king, in order to constantly give check without the king being able to come up and attack the rook. 70.Rd7 Kh3 71.Rh7+ Kg2 72.Kg4 Kf2 73.f5 g2 74.Rh2 Rh1 75.Rxg2+ Kxg2 76.f6 and a drawn position results.} 
Ra1 71.Ke5 
{This is the decisive error. White could still have drawn with the correct move . 71.Rd8 g2 72.Rh8+ Kg3 73.Rg8+ Kf3 74. Ke6 g1Q 75.Rxg1 Rxg1 76.f5 Kf4 77.f6 Kg5 78.f7 Rf1 79.Ke7 Re1+ 80.Kd8 Rf1 81. Ke8 Re1+ 82.Kd8} 
Kg4 
{Now White is going to lose the f-pawn.} 
72.f5 
{72.Rd8 Re1+ 73.Kf6 Kxf4}
