{Annotated by GM Garry Kasparov (RUS).} 1. e4 {Nothing betokened a storm
when I made this move. Topalov (who is always eager to fight no matter if
he has Black or White, if he plays me or any other adversary) answered with
d6.} d6 {I was sincerely surprised. Pirc-Ufimtsev Defense is not a usual one
for Topalov, and this opening is hardly worth using in the tournaments
of the highest category. White has too many opportunities for anybody's
liking: one can lead an acute or a positional game, one can vary different
ways of developing the initiative. Nevertheless, Topalov obviously counted
on surprise, as he thought that I would play worse in a situation I was
not ready for, and besides, he hoped to avoid my opening preparation, which
he had faced before. } 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 {That was when I began to think.
I was actually engrossed in thoughts on the third move, I had often played
3.f3 threatening with King's Indian Defense. However, this opening couldn't
scare Topalov off as he was used to it, moreover, that was what he reckoned
on. That is why I decided to play at sight. I went for a position I had
a definite idea about but never met in practice and, frankly speaking,
had never seriously analyzed. } 4. Be3 Bg7 {Alternative variation: 4...
c6 5. Qd2 b5 6. f3 Bg7 } 5. Qd2 c6 {As far as I know, Black usually plays
c6 and b5 before the move Bg7, but I don't think that this shift changes
something seriously. } 6. f3 {Alternative variation: [It was also possible
to play] 6. Nf3 b5 7. Bd3 [ probably it was even better, but here I have
to repeat that in this opening both adversaries relied not on exact knowledge
but on common sense.] } b5 7. Nge2 {A strange move. Alternative variation:
[If White wanted to play] 7. Bh6 [he could do it at once, leaving the e2-square
free for the other Knight and providing an opportunity to develop the other
Bishop on d3. Theoretically this Knight could move to h3 one day.] Generally
speaking, the move 7.Nge2 has no sense, its reason is purely psychological.
I remembered that before the game, when we discussed the strategy with
[GM] Yury Dokhoian [RUS], he said suddenly looking through Topalov's games:
'You know, Garry, he does not like when the opponent makes the moves he
can not predict. This affects him strangely.' That is why I played 7.Nge2
and surprised Topalov. This move does not contain any threats but continues
the development. However, it seemed to me that he did not like the character
of the fight, as it did not correspond the ideas he had before the game.
} Nbd7 8. Bh6 {Better late than never. It is useful to exchange the Bishop.
} Bxh6 9. Qxh6 {White achieved some sort of success as Black can not castle
in a shorter direction. However, this achievement is rather ephemeral because
the King can hide on the Queen-side as well. White King will also castle
there as a result. Maneuverable fight is waiting ahead and White can not
count on significant gains. } Bb7 {Alternative variation: [Actually, if
Black shows activity] 9... Qa5 [then there is a move ] 10. Nc1 [and then
the Knight moves to b3 with tempo. White will manage to stabilize the game
and he will devoid Black of the opportunity to use the diversion of the
white Queen on h6.] } 10. a3 {I did not want to castle at once, because
it was not clear how to defend the King after Qa5 from the b4 threat. That
is why White makes a wait-and-see move that prepares a long castling and
again, on Qa5 there is a move Nc1 that repulses the b4 threat. Alternative
variation: 10. O-O-O Qa5 11. a3 (11. Qd2 b4 12. Nb1) 11... b4 12. axb4
(12. Nb1) } e5 {Topalov, after thinking for 11 minutes, decided to strengthen
the position in the center and to prepare to castle long. Black had alternative
plans, but this one looked most logical. } 11. O-O-O Qe7 12. Kb1 a6 {It
was probably possible to castle at once, but Topalov defends his King
from the potential threat of d5 just to be on the safe side. I doubt that
this threat was that real, but Black found this move desirable. Alternative
variation: [White did not have a lot of opportunities either; he had to
unravel the tangle of his pieces. That was why I decided to transfer the
Knight to b3, taking advantage of the fact that now Black's attempt to
play actively with a7-a5 would be repulsed:] 12... a5 13. Nc1 b4 14. dxe5
$1 dxe5 (14... Ng8 15. Qg7 Qxe5 16. Qxe5+ dxe5 17. Na4 $16) 15. Na4 bxa3
16. b3 $16 } 13. Nc1 O-O-O 14. Nb3 {The development of both sides is coming
to its end. However, Black has to show some enterprise, as he is under
some pressure. If White develops with g3, Bh3, and Rhe1, then it won't
be easy for Black. Black's King is slightly weakened and, of course, he
should have considered playing c6-c5, but then White would have a choice:
close the position by playing d5, or even to exchange.      It is probably
more promising to close the center. White's space advantage lets him push
for an attack. Then I hoped to make use of Black's weaknesses on the Queen-side.
It was possible to move the Queen from h6 to b6 or to a7. This was an absurd
thought: it flashed across my mind and immediately disappeared, but subconsciously
I formed the idea that the Queen on b6 together with the Knight on a5 could
make a lot of trouble, especially if the white Bishop appears on h3. This
did affect the calculation of variations, but, the mere fact that such
an idea surfaced served as a prologue to a wonderful combination. } exd4
{A very good decision: relief in the center. Taking advantage of the fact
that White is a bit backward in development, Black does not hesitate to
open the game and relies on the possibility that active pieces will compensate
for the weakened position of the King. } 15. Rxd4 c5 16. Rd1 Nb6 {A good
move. Black prepares d6-d5, and I had to think hard for 10 minutes.   
 Now we already have dim contours of a combination. I still could not imagine
how it would look like but I realized that the moves g3 and Bh3 could not
be bad. } 17. g3 {Now the Bishop will move to h3, the Queen will return
to f4, the Knight will go to a5, and the blow will take place somewhere
in that area. At that moment, however, I did not know exactly what this
blow would be like. Nevertheless, the idea to dispose the pieces in such
a way already reigned over my mind. Alternative variation: [ What does
White do next? Let's say if] 17. a4 [ then Black gets a good position after]
b4 18. a5 bxc3 19. axb6 Nd7 Alternative variation: [ And in case of] 17.
Na5 d5 18. Nxb7 (18. g3 d4) 18... Kxb7 19. exd5 Nbxd5 20. Nxd5 Nxd5 21.
Bd3 f5 22. Rhe1 Qc7 23. Bf1 c4 [we have a complicated position with mutual
chances. Of course, the black King is out in the open, but the white Bishop
is hemmed in by the pawns. Black is sound in the center, and it is most
likely that the position is in a state of dynamic balance.] } Kb8 {Topalov
thinks that he has some time and can calmly prepare for d6-d5. } 18. Na5
{Alternative variation: [It is important to say that if White had not played
the Knight to a5 on the 18th move but immediately played] 18. Bh3 [ then
the white Knight would not have reached the a5-square after Nb3.] } Ba8
19. Bh3 d5 {So, both sides have fulfilled what was planned: White has finished
the development and Black has played d6-d5.     Though, generally speaking,
there was such an opportunity and it was possible to play Rhe1, but that
would have been another game. I tried to systematically fulfill the plan
that I expected to end in a sacrifice.     The move 24.Rxd4 was already
clear in my mind, though I had not yet realized the possibility of a draw
by repetition of moves. I just saw the outline of an attack. } 20. Qf4+
Ka7 21. Rhe1 {That was when I saw the possibility of a draw. Moreover,
I felt that there was a possibility to continue the game, to play without
the Rook, though I could not imagine what it would lead to. However, the
image of the black King on a5 comforted my heart and intuition given to
every man from birth, intuition of an 'attacker' (let's call it that way),
told me that there would be decision and a mate net around the black King
would be spun in spite of the huge material advantage of the adversary.
    Besides, I was whipped up by curiosity of unexplored. Will there ever
be another opportunity to lure out the black King into the center of my
own camp!? In the long run, Lasker's ancient game [Lasker, Edward - Sir
Thomas, George. London 1912.] with a sacrifice on h7 and King's move g8-g1
was like a myth to us. Such a thing could happen only in those distant
times, we assume. And suddenly, this opportunity! Topalov looked quite
confident. He played d4. } d4 {Alternative variation: [Certainly, after]  21...
dxe4 22. fxe4 [the game is open and now the threat 23.Nd5 gives Black a
lot of trouble: the black King is too weak.] } 22. Nd5 {Frankly speaking,
this move is not the strongest but it serves as a prologue for a further
combination. Alternative variation: [White, of course, could have played]
22. Na2 [but after] Rhe8 [ or h7-h6 the game would have become very complicated.
So naturally, my hand led the Knight to the center.] } Nbxd5 23. exd5 Qd6
{#    It seemed to me that Topalov was a bit surprised, as he thought that
attacking resources had dried out. A check on c6 was senseless, the Knight
will be beaten, the King will go to b6, and there is hardly any opportunity
for White to move his Rooks toward the black King. The d4-pawn safely protects
the d-rank, and there are no squares for intrusion on the e-rank. Actually,
this was not quite right, and my next move, made without any hesitation,
turned out to be an unpleasant surprise for Topalov. } 24. Rxd4 {When I
made this move, I saw only the repetition of the moves and the opportunity
to continue the attack, though the whole picture of the combination was
not yet clear. I already saw the idea 30.. .Rd6 31.Rb6, but I still could
not get rid of the thought that all lines should be checked to the very
end. Maybe black will find some opportunity for defense. Topalov spent
about 15 minutes thinking.     I walked around the hall - rather, I fled
- and at these feverish moments it seemed to me that there were very few
participants and that most of the games had already been finished. My mind
worked only in one direction, and one of these moments brought me the image
of the whole cluster of various lines. I saw the move 37. Rd7. I don't
even remember how this line was formed in my head, but I saw the whole
line up to the end. I saw the journey of the black King after 36.Bf1, 37.
Rd7 and I could no longer suppress my excitement, because at that same
moment I realized that the move 24...Kb6 ruined the whole construction.
     The mere thought that I could spoil such a combination drove me crazy,
and I only prayed that Topalov would capture on d4. I still was not sure
that this would win, but the beauty of the combination I saw impressed
me.     I could not believe my own eyes when Veselin twitched abruptly
and grabbed the Rook. As he explained after the game, he was exhausted
by the tense fight and he thought that White would have to force a draw
by the repetition of moves after the Rook was captured. He saw the main
idea of the combination, but it did not occur to him that White would play
without the Rook, trying to make use of the King's forward position on
a4. } cxd4 {This move loses the game, but it is worth an exclamation mark,
as great combinations cannot be created without partners. If Topalov had
not taken the Rook, the game could have finished in a draw: Veselin would
have had half a point more, I - half a point less. He would have win a
little bit, I would have lost a little bit, but chess and chess amateurs
would have lost a lot. However, Caissa was kind to me that day.. . I do
not know what I was rewarded for, but the development of events became
forced after the capture on d4. Alternative variation: [Maybe,  if Topalov
had played] 24... Kb6 [then I could have found the move] 25. Nb3 $1 [ which
again makes it impossible to capture the Rook:] ([I was intending to play
] 25. b4 [as I underestimated the fact that after] Qxf4 (25... Nxd5 26.
Qxd6+ Rxd6 27. bxc5+ Kxc5 28. Nb3+ Kb6 29. Kb2 Rhd8 30. Red1 Bc6 31. f4
Kc7 $11) 26. Rxf4 Nxd5 27. Rxf7 cxb4 28. axb4 Nxb4 29. Nb3 Rd6 [Black's
position is better.] ) 25... Bxd5 $1 (25... cxd4 $2 26. Qxd4+ Kc7 27. Qa7+

28. Qh6 Qf8 29. Rh4 $16) 26. Qxd6+ Rxd6 27. Rd2 Rhd8 28. Red1 $11 [and
White keeps equality, but not more.] Alternative variation: 24... Bxd5

f4 } 25. Re7+ {I made this move with lightening speed. And there was nothing
to think about. The Rook was inviolable. Such moves are always made with
pleasure, and all I have said before (that the d-rank is closed by the
d4-pawn and that there are no squares for intrusion on the e-rank) turned
out to be ruined. Two white Rooks sacrifice themselves, and thus, the way
to the black camp is opened for White's pieces. The construction I dreamt
of - Queen on b6, Knight on a5 - has suddenly come true, because of the
Bishop on h3. Alternative variation: [ I have to say that] 25. Qxd4+ [did
not achieve the goal because of] Qb6 26. Re7+ Nd7 [and White's attack fades
away.] } Kb6 {Alternative variation: [If Black moves] 25... Kb8 26. Qxd4
$1 [then after] Nd7 27. Bxd7 Bxd5 28. c4 $1 Qxe7 29. Qb6+ Ka8 30. Qxa6+
Kb8 31. Qb6+ Ka8 32. Bc6+ $1 Bxc6 33. Nxc6 [Black loses by force.] } 26.
Qxd4+ Kxa5 {Alternative variation: [ Some of the participants, including
Anand, asserted that the move] 26... Qc5 [ saved the game. However, after]
27. Qxf6+ Qd6 28. Be6 [White closed the rank but left the opportunity to
vary threats and to force Black into a desperate position. For example]
Bxd5 (28... Rhe8 29. b4 $1 $18) 29. b4 $1 Ba8 30. Qxf7 Qd1+ 31. Kb2 Qxf3
32. Bf5 [would be the simplest way, as all the lines are closed and mate
threats become inevitable.] } 27. b4+ Ka4 28. Qc3 {I made the last move
without hesitations. Frankly speaking, I could not make myself think as
I strove for the end. I already saw it, and it seemed to me that it was
the way to finish the game, that Black could not avoid it, and that there
were no other defenses. Veselin gave me time when he was thinking himself,
but I could not make myself look for another opportunity. My hopes were
in vain! However, it is difficult to judge. It seems to me that the beauty
of this combination is not inferior to a side line. Though in order to
be objective from the point of view of chess truth, it would be stronger
to play 28.Ra7! Alternative variation: 28. Ra7 [This move was found by
Lubomir Kavalek, probably with the help of a computer, as it is impossible
to look through all the lines independently. Nevertheless, the idea found
by Kavalek provided the opportunity to realize all problem motives in a
clearer way, keeping Black from using new defensive resources. Such resources
could appear in the game as played, though, frankly speaking, they were
not enough.] [ The strongest move, as in the game itself, is] Bb7 ([ So,
after 28.Ra7! both captures on d5 lose quickly:] 28... Nxd5 29. Rxa6+ $3
Qxa6 30. Qb2 Nc3+ 31. Qxc3 Bd5 32. Kb2 $18 [# and we approached the position
when there was no defense from the threat of Queen's self-sacrifice on
b3. Black can not attract another piece to control the a2-g8 diagonal,
as the white Bishop controls the e6-square.] (32. --)) ([ The Bishop's
capture on d5 also loses:] 28... Bxd5 29. Qc3 Rhe8 30. Kb2 Re2 [ Black
linked the c2-pawn and defended from the Qb3 threat. And here the Queen
suddenly changes its route-] 31. Qc7 $1 [ threatening with a mate from
a5. And after] Qxc7 32. Rxa6+ [the King turns out to be mated by the white
Rook. A wonderful scheme of mating pieces!]) 29. Rxb7 [The continuation
after] Qxd5 ([After] 29... Nxd5 [ White finds a new mating construction]
30. Bd7 $1 [threatening with Bxb5+ to expose the black King and to mate
it again wi} Qxd5 {Here, Topalov had less than half an hour, I had 32 minutes.
Alternative variation: [ It would be even weaker to play] 28... Bxd5 [because
of] 29. Kb2 [ with inevitable mate.] } 29. Ra7 Bb7 30. Rxb7 {Alternative
variation: [ White refuses the last opportunity to force a perpetual checkmate
playing] 30. Qc7 [I was sure that White would achieve more.] Qd1+ 31. Kb2
Qd4+ 32. Kb1 $11 It is important that there is no checkmate on d1, because
the white King suddenly goes to a2 and it turns out that the threat Qb3
can be also supported by the King from the a2-square.     That is why the
black Queen has to be on d5 (one has to understand this very important
moment), in order to control the b3-square and to be able to play Qd4 if
the white King is on b2. Therefore, the Rook should be on d8. It leaves
enough opportunities for most various problem motives that are more vivid
in this particular line. Both adversaries saw the line and Topalov, having
spent some of his precious minutes, played Qc4.} Qc4 {This is the most natural
defense, and I counted on it, too. Moreover, this is the defense that leads
to the most effective mating end that I had no rest from for the last 15-20
minutes, ever since its image mysteriously arose in my mind. Actually,
Black had two other defenses, and each of them could have ruined the delicate
conception that I had in mind. Alternative variation: [ The first one was]
30... Rhe8 [the move Topalov showed on the next day before the round started.
Thus he drove me into a tight corner in my game with Reinderman, where
I was deep in thought calculating various lines after 30... Rhe8 and, not
being able to find the way out. I was very careless in the opening, making
two slips and mixing everything up. Fortunately, I rethought quickly, got
rid of all these fixed ideas and nightmares and played a marvelous game.
However, Topalov's idea was not likely to live a long life, because everyone
was interested in this game and the statement that the move Rhe8 could
refute White's brilliant composition must have caused inward protest. So,
at the end of the round, Ligterink proudly showed a brilliant victory for
White.] [Thus, White plays] 31. Rb6 Ra8 32. Bf1 [Objecting to .. .Qc4,
White creates a quiet threat Rd6, which is crucial in the case of Nd7.]
( [It is important to note that the move] 32. Be6 [ which suggests itself,
does not achieve the goal:] Rxe6 33. Rxe6 [And Black, course, can not capture
the rook on e6, as after Kb2 there is no defense from the mate, but plays]
Qc4 [ This is the very counter-sacrifice that I told you about.] [ White
has to beat c4:] 34. Qxc4 bxc4 35. Rxf6 Kxa3 [and then] 36. Rxf7 Re8 [
Black starts a counter-attack and, strange as it may seem, keeps good chances
to win the ending.     White cannot allow such exchanges and, as we can
see, the c4-square is now crucial. Black could change the defense, playing
30... Rhe8. In this case one Rook would defend the a6-pawn from a8, and
the move Kb2 faces Qe5. The Rook controls the } 31. Qxf6 Kxa3 {Topalov
still erred in thinking that White had nothing better than 32.Qxa6 Kxb4
and 33.Bd7. Really, White has no other possibilities as the King is under
mate himself. Alternative variation: [Black misses the best defense that
let him continue the resistance in the ending playing] 31... Rd1+ [And
then] 32. Kb2 Ra8 33. Qb6 $1 [threatening a mate from a5.] Qd4+ ([ At]
33... a5 34. Bd7 [is decisive]) 34. Qxd4 Rxd4 35. Rxf7 [ Technically, it
is the most complicated decision.] ([I planned to play 35.Bd7. Analysis
showed that this was also enough for the victory. White tries to dominate,
to press the black pieces, and he prepares to move the King-side pawns,
taking advantage of the fact that the Rook should be on a8. Black tries
to defend himself from Bb5+ and not to let the Bishop go to b3. Nevertheless,
he does not succeed.     After] 35. Bd7 $5 Rd2 36. Bc6 f5 37. Rb6 Ra7 38.

Rxf7 42. c3 [After] Ra7 [the only way is to play] 43. Re6 a5 44. Re1 [and
we come across a new mating construction. This time it is a front checkmate
from a1; the Rook mates the black King on the a-rank.]) [Black must play]
35... a5 36. Be6 axb4 37. Bb3+ Ka5 38. axb4+ [and it turns out that the
Rook can not capture on b4 because after c3 this Rook is trapped and the
ending is technically won. Then after] Kb6 (38... Rxb4 39. c3) 39. Rxh7
Rc8 40. h4 [White has to win this position without much trouble. The Bishop
and three pawns are much stronger than the Rook. White's disposition is
marvelous and his victory is a point of time.     However, the continuation
35.Bd7 was more effective, and I counted on it during the game because,
frankly speaking, I did not see that after 38. axb4+ Rxb4 the move 39.c3
trapped the Rook.] Nevertheless, Topalov took on a3 with the King, and
the line I dreamt of came true!      Once again, tried to check the lines,
and, afraid to believe my own eyes, I made sure that what I had thought
of for so long } 32. Qxa6+ Kxb4 {# } 33. c3+ {Probably, that was when Topalov
realized everything. Of course, he saw the move 36...Rd2 and then, as it
often happens to chess players, he immediately saw 37.Rd7. Black has no
choice, he has to take with the King on c3. } Kxc3 34. Qa1+ Kd2 {Alternative
variation: [There is no way back:] 34... Kb4 35. Qb2+ Ka5 36. Qa3+ Qa4
37. Ra7+ [winning the Queen.] } 35. Qb2+ Kd1 {The black King has made the
way to his Calvary - from e8 to d1 - across the whole chessboard! And when
it seems that he has reached a quiet harbor (White has no more checkmates),
the Bishop, which was on h3 and did nothing but shot in the emptiness and
defended the e6 square, made his move. Alternative variation: [Another
change of mating constructions! In fact, we should not forget another opportunity:
in stead of 35...Kd1] 35... Ke3 [can be played, then the continuation would
be] 36. Re7+ Kxf3 37. Qg2# } 36. Bf1 {#    White attacked the Queen who
can not escape: if he retreats along the c-rank the move 37.Qe2 and a checkmate
would follow, and retreat to e6 will cause a mate from c1. Alternative
variation: [ This is one more of the innumerable mating finals. Thus, after]
36. Bf1 [ the Bishop is also inviolable, as after] Qxf1 37. Qc2+ Ke1 38.
Re7+ [- I don't  know who would like such a mate. This is a trifle in comparison
with all we had before.] } Rd2 {Black makes a counterblow and for another
second it seems that the worst is left behind, because White seems to have
no more resources. Alternative variation: 36... Qc5 37. Qe2# Alternative
variation: 36... Qe6 37. Qc1# With one more second to rest, Black will
announce checkmate to the white King himself. But this is where the white
Rook enters. } 37. Rd7 {#    The weakness of the a1-h8 diagonal is the
most important element of this combination. Usually everything depends
on such trifles. If only the black Rook had been on g8, there would have
been no combination at all... And after 37.Rd7 Black has nothing else to
hope for. However, Topalov still continued the fight mechanically. Black
has to take the Rook on d7. } Rxd7 38. Bxc4 bxc4 39. Qxh8 Rd3 {This moves
gives the illusion of activity. If Black suddenly takes on h7, then after
c3 he will queen the black pawn. But we did not play draughts, it was not
obligatory to capture, and now the Queen could show her true strength.
} 40. Qa8 {Moving closer to the battlefield. } c3 41. Qa4+ Ke1 42. f4 {And
thus Black is deprived of the last hope to get a position of 'the Rook
against the Queen' that demands a certain accuracy from the strongest side,
if playing a computer. And still, as practice has proved, a weaker side
in the battle of two chess players is not able to resist, as it is nearly
impossible to make a 'computer move' that would take the Rook away from
the King. However, it is not necessary to know all these nuances. White
keeps a lot of pawns so that Black could hope to win them sometime. } f5
43. Kc1 {Neutralizes any Black's hope connected with c-pawn. } Rd2 44.
Qa7 {The Queen starts attacking black pawns, and the h2-pawn is inviolable
because of Qg1+.     Topalov resigned and this wonderful game was over.
