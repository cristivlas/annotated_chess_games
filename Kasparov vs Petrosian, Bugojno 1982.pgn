1. d4 {This is a very instructional positional game played by a young Gary
Kasparov, and a former world champion, Petrosian, who is reduced to a state
of complete paralysis.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Bb4+ {A useful check, Black
develops his second piece and is ready to castle.} 4. Bd2 {Objectively
speaking, not the most ambitious move in Bogo theory. Here 4. Nbd2 is
considered to be stronger these days, but Kasparov's reasoning is that
Black is going to play ...d5 at some point and the exchange of dark-squared
bishops will leave Black with weakness on the dark squares. Also, the
remaining Black light-squared bishop will be bad, as it is hemmed in by
its own central pawns.} Qe7 {Black is in no hurry to exchange on d2, as
after 4. Qxd2 d5 5. Nc3, White keeps a slight edge. Alternatively, if
White tries to act in the center now, Black is able to force off another
set of pieces after 4...Bxc3 5. Bxc3 Ne4. As a general rule, the side
with less space will seek exchanges to make more room for his pieces.}
5. g3 {White's pressure will be based around the influence of the g2 Bishop.}
Bxd2+ {The Bishop has served it's purpose of restraining White's expansion
in the center, so Petrosian decides to exchange it off.} 6. Qxd2 O-O 7.
Bg2 d5 {Black finally issues a challenge to the White center.} 8. O-O dxc4
{This move gets a ?! dubious mark as Black is in too much of a hurry to
simplify. It is far better to keep a barrier to the g2 Bishop with 8...Rd8
9. Qc2 Nc6 10. cd ed 11. Nc3 Bg4 when Black would have active pieces to
compensate for his slightly weak pawn structure on the Queenside. The
White Bishop, which becomes a terror in the game continuation would have
been kept under better control.} 9. Na3 {An excellent idea!! White intends
to recapture on c4 with his Queen's Knight rather than lose time with 9.
Ne5 c5, when Black has a fighting chance as White still has two pieces
sleeping on the Queenside.} c5 {The elimination of White's strong central
pawn will open a highway into the Black position.} 10. dxc5 {The correct
capture as it will lure the Black Queen to a square where it can be the
subject of tempo gaining attacks by the White pieces.} Qxc5 11. Rac1 {White
has the initiative due to his more active pieces.} Nc6 {Black can't defend
the c4 pawn with b5 as ...Nd4 will win the pawn back and give White a better
game.} 12. Nxc4 Qe7 {Removing the Queen from the line of fire, but the
best move was 12...Rd8.} 13. Nfe5 {Now Black is unable to solve the fundamental
problem of developing the c8 Bishop without giving White strong pressure
on the b7 pawn.} Nxe5 14. Nxe5 {White is in absolute control of the c-file.
 Black now can't play 14...Be7 clearing a spot for the a-rook, as 15. Rc7
is crushing.} Nd5 {Petrosian offers a pawn to accelerate his development.
 After 15. Bxd5? exd5 16. Qxd5 Bh3 17. Rd1 Rfd8 all of Black's pieces come
to life, and the c8 bishop is the best piece on the board and Black's rooks
enjoy open lines.} 15. Rfd1 {White's pieces are taking up premium squares.}
Nb6 16. Qa5 {The sublety behind this move is that if now 16...f6
attempting to drive away the e5 Knight, then 17. Nc4 Nxc4 18. Rxc4 and
Black cannot prevent a rook invasion of the 7th rank, as the White Queen
is controlling c7.} g6 {A little breathing room please!} 17. Rd3 {Another
exclam, as now Black is prevented from exchanging a set of rooks with ...Rd8.
 The point is that 17...Rd8 is met with 18. Qc5! Qxc5 19. Rxd8 Qf8 20.
Rxf8 and 21. Rc7 and the pawns on the second rank will be massacred by
the White rook. If White had hesitated with a natural move like 17. e4,
Black can ease his task by 17...Rd8, as 18. Qc5?? is met by Rxd1 losing
the Queen.} Nd5 18. e4 {The White bishop is now locked in, however, chess
is a game of give and take. The Knight on d5 blocks White's pressure down
the d-file and guards against a Rook invasion on c7. Overall, the White
pieces are doing fine with this move.} Nb6 {18...Nf6 19. Rc7!} 19. Bf1
{There are no blazing tactics here, so Kasparov reasons that since Black
isn't able to do anything constructive, he will slowly improve all of his
pieces.} Re8 20. Rdd1 {Clears the way for the Bishop and is safer on d1.}
Rf8 {Black has no other choice but to wait for White to attack.} 21. a3
{Black will not be able to cope with the advance of the Queenside pawns.
 Once Kasparov gets a pawn to a5, forcing the knight back, Black's defences
will crumble.} Kg7 22. b3 Kg8 {Black has no moves on the Queenside that
don't lose a piece. On the Kingside, the Rook and the King can continue
to shuffle back and forth, and the Queen can move, but once she does the
Rook hits c7.} 23. a4 Rd8 {Black tries an active move, but is instantly
punished.} 24. Qc5 {And here Petrosian resigns in the face of 24...Qxc5
25. Rxd8 Qf8 26. Rxf8 Kxf8 27. Rc7 when Black is menaced with a5 winning
the Knight, and the Kingside pawn structure will collapse after 28. Rxf7.
 A positional brilliancy by Kasparov.} 1-0
