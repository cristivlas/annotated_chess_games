1. e4 c5
2. d3 g6
3. c4 e5
4. Bd2 Nc6
5. Nf3 Qb6
6. a4 { I was waiting for Qxb2, to follow with:
Bc3 Qb6 8. Nxe5 Nxe5 9. Bxe5 Nf6 10. a5 Qe6
in some vague hope of controlling the center. }
 d6 { Blowfish didn't byte }
7. a5 Nxa5
8. Bxa5 Qxb2
{ and now the Queen is about to get trapped. }
9. Nc3 Nf6
10. Ra2 { and it should be very easy from here. Now go back to 9. Nc3 and replay the (improved) AI from there
to see a better response than 9... Nf6 }
